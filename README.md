The aim of the app is to query the relevant metadata about an artist and their albums from the database and display them to the user. 

The app consists of:
- A start page where users can enter the name of an artist in a search field, then all albums on an artist will be shown to the user. The user can then mark the artist as favourite.
- A favorite artist page where all artist which were marked as favorite will be displayed.

Note: [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API) was used for the query of the data.
